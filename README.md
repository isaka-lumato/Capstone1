# Microverse HTML, CSS, JS Capstone Project

"This website is an announcement for the upcoming Launch event. The event will be held within Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University Technology Club. General information about the event is given throughout the site. Speakers are introduced in a separate section."

The website content is fictional. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet the requirements defined within the scope of the Microverse Capstone project. In particular, I would like to point out that I built this website completely from scratch.
